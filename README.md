# InnovateS
* I have created this prototype where Sunita Sharma can track her daily activity.
* With increasing age also it is important for an inidividual to trck her daily activity, in this case Sunita can add the activities like her medication, physical activities, meditation or family time and track them using this prototype.
* Considering all the above features, Sunita Sharma should be able to live a happier and healthier life

## Alternative approach:
* At this age group, it somtimes become difficult for people to interact or socialize with others as most of them in their vicinity may not be of the persons age group. As a result, it is important to create a socializng platform for elderly people where people of the same age group can interact with each other.
* Considering, people currently of this age group were born in or before 1960's, which was a time wherein people did not get sufficient education which might result in them not being able to handle such tools. However, this idea can be used in future when things would get more better when it comes to usage of such things even by people of the age of Sunita Sharma.
* At that very age, people might not be looking for a solution all the time, but they want someone to listen to them, what they can find using this application and that too of their same age group.
